		<p>Hi there! My name’s Dana Ravvin, and it’s a pleasure to have this site seen by you. I’m currently enrolled in The New School in the Bachelor’s/Master’s program for Psychology. Don’t let that fool you - I come from a family of very creative people, so I’ve been writing short stories and essays, taking photos at those perfect opportunities, and drawing from the get-go. Whenever I get any free time, I instantly gravitate towards a pen and paper. I did some coding work in high school and found that I loved making pages organized, pretty, and very easy to use for others. I am aiming for a career in user experience research.</p>

		<p>Beautiful faces. Not-so-beautiful faces. Sunsets. Color coordination. Light contrast. Shamelessness. Big words. Dreams. Nightmares. The objects and ideas that inspire me are absolutely endless. My style dynamically changes every day, thus changing my cultivation of experiences. I used to write a lot of short stories that tried to contain the ideas for novels; throughout my last two essay writing classes, I’ve delved deeper into writing about conscientiousness and the self. Most of my art is done digitally in either Adobe Photoshop or Adobe Illustrator, a lot of which being versions of my friends. My photography, on the other hand, has a lot to do with color contrast and white balance. I love taking photos of dark subjects with a singular light focus. </p>
