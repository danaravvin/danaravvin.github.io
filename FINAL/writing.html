		<span class="w-title">25 things about home</span>
		<p class="w-body">
			1. The stacked candles and burnt out matches on the black windowsill, waiting to be relit and add a romantic glow to the living room. <br> <br>
			2. The table my roommate and I brought up the five flights from outside, probably stolen from one of our neighbors. A few days later, my dad came and chopped off the legs to the perfect height. <br> <br>
			3. Stark blue velvet couch. <br> <br>
			4. A seat for me and a seat for my roommate - I like to sit in the corner. Or a bed for a friend staying the night. <br> <br>
			5. A 3 am memory of picking up a road sign from the street directly across our building and proceeding to screw it into the wall. Also at 3 am. <br> <br>
			6. Self-proclaimed "No Right Turn," a phrase we found very relatable. <br> <br>
			7. The largest wall in the living room became what we came to call our wall of failures. <br> <br>
			8. A stainless steel frying pan hangs there, off a screw that was there when we moved in, unsalvagable unless I buy some steel wool. <br> <br>
			9. A piece of paper outlining the two weekends my best friend could go and lose her virginity in Washington DC. <br> <br>
			10. The winning weekend circled in red. <br> <br>
			11. That piece of paper hangs there now as a replacement for the manifestation of a mutual mental breakdown my roommate and I had, referred to now as The List. <br> <br>
			12. A large, Parsons-sized piece of cardstock with more than 20 names on it, split down the middle to differentiate between my roommate's side and mine. The boys written there are now forever eternalized as "failures": relationships that didn't work out or didn't even have a chance to blossom. <br> <br>
			13. Forever eternalized. Repetition. <br> <br>
			14. We buy the same food every time we go grocery shopping. More repetition. <br> <br>
			15. The pantry is stocked with her bread and bagels and pasta. <br> <br>
			16. The fridge is stocked with my cucumbers and tomatoes and salad mix. <br> <br>
			17. The tomatoes have now moved to outside of the fridge so that they last longer. <br> <br>
			18. A bookshelf that - again - my father helped customize to fit the space. Draped in fairy lights that we never unplug. <br> <br>
			19. The acrylic chair we picked up from the street sits next to the couch, generally used as something to put our bags on top of. <br> <br>
			20. There are dishes sitting on the table. My roommate tends to avoid cleaning up after herself until it's absolutely necessary. <br> <br>
			21. (I'm tired of it.) <br> <br>
			22. The incredible height is always pronounced by the 4-hinged 9-foot doors, a blessing in a small NYC apartment. <br> <br>
			23. There's nothing but brick and windows for a view, but we enjoy watching "hookah girl" and try to count the number of men she has over within a month. I'm sure she watches us too sometimes. <br> <br>
			24. And then you walk outside, look to the left, and see the Empire State Building, only five avenues away. <br> <br>
			25. And she is home.

		<span class="w-title">speculative scenario – viruses, botnets, & ransomeware</span>
		<p class="w-body">
			&emsp;Molly was walking up to the Union Square train station in the middle of the actual park after closing up her job at the Think Coffee on 4th Avenue. She had been the last to leave and was dreading having to go back to her cheap apartment in Brooklyn during rush hour. It was exactly 6:37 pm – people were rushing to get back to Brooklyn and Queens after work or school and before the L train shuts down for the night. As Molly walked by one of the other stations, she saw people slowing down on the stairs. Another station, one with a canopy that protected everyone from the blinding sunrays, had fallen into a complete standstill – people were just standing on the stairs, all trying to peer over one another in an attempt to figure out why no one was moving. Molly finally got to the entrance she always uses after work and pushed her way through the others just standing; she was surprised to see that most of the crowd was on the actual stairs, and the area before the turnstiles was relatively empty. She swiped through and joined the group of people standing along the yellow line, looking over the edge of the platform to see if a train was coming or not. Men and women were slowly following the pursuit of others and leaving the station, running out of patience rather quickly. Molly looked to the electronic signs hanging from the ceiling, which usually depict the expectant train line and arrival time, but now instead were either turned off completely or repeatedly blinked out the message “SRY BUT IT IS 2 L8.” <br><br>
			&emsp;She walked all the way to where the front of the train was to stop. There were three MTA workers dressed in yellow reflective vests standing on the tracks, fiddling with what Molly assumed must be the signaling system that the dispatchers always use as an excuse for train delays. It looked fairly similar to a standard road traffic light – there were three lights on each block light, green, yellow, and red, and two blocks stacked vertically. Instead of just flashing one light on each, the two greens, yellows, and reds were all flashing at the same time. The workers were working on the wiring, trying to move things around, believing it was just a glitch in the system. Molly overheard one of the say that if all the signals were acting like this, the trains were screwed – there’s no GPS system on the trains because of the concrete foundation of the whole subway system, so there could easily be crashes happening in the very moment, and no one would even know.  <br><br>
			&emsp;Molly decided to walk back to the other end, to see closer if there was an incoming train. As she made her way there, she walked by the turnstiles, around which a panicked crowd had built up. She asked an older man what happened, to which he replied, “We think they got hacked!” and pointed at the screen on the turnstile furthest from them. Molly had read about these before – the MTA system was slowly but surely transitioning into a cardless system, where you would be able to pay for the train with a simple swipe of your phone. The screens had been put in some stations for individuals who were currently participating in the beta testing of this system; it reminded her a lot of the oyster card system that London uses in their public transportation routes. She made her way through to the three people holding their phones – they had each just tried to swipe in using their phones. Their access through the turnstiles were blocked, and all of their phone screens had turned black for a minute before flashing the same message that was flashing on the screens in the station: “SRY BUT IT IS 2 L8.” As soon as they tried to press any of the buttons on their device they were hit with an alert box that required multiple payments to be sent to a Venmo address under the alias of @843jBgdo)-2!8hM. <br><br>
			&emsp;Molly kept walking to the end of the platform. They station was practically empty at this point – everyone had given up on waiting and instead chose to find another way home. She was surprised when she saw lights flash from somewhere inside the tunnel, getting closer and brighter with each second. As the train got closer, she could see the conductor at the front, moving his hands frantically trying to get someone’s attention. He transitioned to honking the horn, now seeing the MTA workers at the other end of the train. It was obvious that he no longer had control of the train. It took Molly a moment to process the whole situation, but she soon started shouting “Get off the tracks!” over and over again, trying to get the workers’ attention.  <br><br>
			&emsp;She would find out later, when she finally made it home via Uber, that the Union Square L train crash was merely one of 30 that occurred across the city, and that this was all planned by a group that called themselves 2L8 in an attempt to humiliate and exploit the government public system.

		<span class="w-title">surrounding violence and toxicity and their effect on Édouard Louis - autofiction & the hybrid memoir</span>
		<p class="w-body">
			&emsp;An unapologetic portrayal is the best way to give voice to an underrepresented, often forgotten group of people and their ideology. Édouard Louis wrote about the gory highs and lows of living in a dated, isolated town as a person considered to be different from everybody else. Louis writes with an extreme vividness and a detachment and distance in order to recount and understand every moment of his childhood pain and the reasons behind it. There is evidence of not only physical and verbal abuse that the author confronted, but also the self-inflicted violence that grew from being raised in the French town of Hallencourt. Louis also introduces the issue of femininity and masculinity in his blunt portrayal of the men and women of the town, and how these roles affect daily life. In The End of Eddy, Édouard Louis explores themes of violence, both external and internalized, along with gender norms to demonstrate how maturation in a toxic environment influences and shapes a person and their life.<br><br>
			&emsp;Louis endured an absurd amount of cruelty from his surroundings. Whether it was from his family, his friends, or those who bullied him, the beatings and verbal abuse he suffered changed the way Louis saw the world and how he interacted with the people and ideas that surrounded him. One of the earliest and most pressing instances of cruelty he introduces is that of the two boys – a redhead and one with a hunchback – that remain one of the most prominent memories and feelings throughout the book and throughout Louis’s life. It quickly becomes evident that this pair was the primary bully Louis faced, as they consistently took direct action against him. The boys rename unnamed, showing them off as a dangerous entity rather than two separate people; the names don’t even matter. The turning point of the dynamic between Louis and the two boys came after the author had been exposed to gay sex for the first time and then had been exposed as taking part in it as the supposed inferior subject in the situation. In one of the most stomach-churning recollections: “That morning, he spat on the sleeve of my jacket, a greenish gob so thick it just sat there…I smiled again, just like I always did…I continued licking the jacket while they went on giving their orders, until the gobs had disappeared.” (Louis 138) By saying he “smiled again,” Louis echoed smiling in an earlier instance with the two boys – he smiled to fit in. He believed that smiling would make the others think as though he was in on the joke, that instead of being laughed at he could laugh with and make it look as if he wasn’t being torn down, piece by piece. Louis had grown so used to the beatings – he talked about constantly returning to the empty hallway where the two boys would find him, even going as far as to call it “an appointment, an unspoken contract” (25) – that something as jarring as being forced to ingest someone else’s bodily fluids only intensified the shock and humiliation he endured. Just like with the town he was in, Louis did not see a way to get out, and had to obey in order to protect himself from the possibility of something worse. <br><br>
			&emsp;Not all of the bullying he underwent was physical. Throughout his book, Louis talks about the whispers that followed him, from the students at school to his family to the adults of the town. He describes a memory of walking through the halls at school, suddenly the center of attention: “There in the hallway they asked me who I was, if I was Bellegueule, the one everyone was talking about…You’re the faggot, right? By saying it they inscribed it on me permanently like stigmata…” (5) Rumors spread very easily, especially in a school filled with children hungry for interesting information, so as soon as Louis was labeled as a homosexual, the tag stuck. Stigmata were marks that the Greeks carved into people who were classified as deviant or dangerous to their community, in order to identify them as such and protect others. With a label like “faggot” figuratively carved into Louis, he would have to carry that label around with him throughout his childhood, and no one would see him as otherwise. He became the one student who was constantly singled out, only getting a break when someone new and different came along to distract away from him. The comparison he made to stigmata emphasized the idea of hate stemming from fear and a lack of understanding; because Louis acted differently and didn’t match up the town’s ideas of a masculine man even at the young age of 10, everyone around him ostracized and made fun of him, the verbal abuse allowing them to feel superior while maintaining a sense of ignorance. <br><br>
			&emsp;Some of the beatings that affected Louis weren’t ones that he himself had endured, such as the fights he always saw outside of bars that were completely normalized in their village. To be specific, one scene depicts his half-brother having had too much to drink and exploding in anger at Louis and his little brother for being “pussies” and “spoiled brats” (40). He then tried to lash out at Louis for being raised differently than he had. Louis’s father stepped in to protect him, but his half-brother didn’t stop: “He hit my father. My father didn’t want to fight back, he refused, not wanting to hit his own son. He had slapped him now and then…but wouldn’t hit him in this context, he wouldn’t get into an actual fight with his son.” (41) Louis hid and didn’t actually see the fight but was told about it the next day by his mother. This experience showed Louis that hatred runs deeper than blood – his half-brother didn’t even hesitate to hit a family member, whether it was the intended subject or the interim victim. <br><br>
			&emsp;In the beginning of the book, Louis’s father claimed that he didn’t want to become like his father and hit his children. Whenever Louis did something his father didn’t like, he was scolded and punished, but never physically hit. Even when Louis’s half-brother tried to hurt Louis, the father stepped in to protect Louis and wouldn’t fight back – he kept the promise he made to himself not to be like his father. However, one of the turning points of the book is when, finally, Louis’s breaks his promise of never hurting one of his children and hits Louis, towards the end of the book. It only showed Louis, at his most impressionable age, that what he had done was innately wrong and disgraceful, to have brought his father to this point of anger and disappointment. <br><br>
			&emsp;All of the disgust aimed towards men who were gay or effeminate taught Louis that there was something wrong with him. Anyone who is told something over and over again by people they respect or view as authority will eventually begin to believe it. When he was young, he had gone into his sister’s room and decided to try on her clothes: “Breathless after the euphoria of the runway show had passed, I would suddenly feel idiotic, sullied by the girls’ clothes I had been wearing, or not just idiotic but disgusted with myself, stunned by the momentary fit of madness that had made me cross-dress.” (16) He had finally found a version of himself where he was happy and felt elated but had to tear himself down just like those who had done it to him before. He was always told that cross-dressing is wrong, that being normal means being a man means liking masculine things and rejecting anything that was portrayed as female – or weak. Louis had no choice but to internalize the loathing he had seen around him and began to hurt himself by enforcing the idea that he had to hide a huge part of himself in order to protect himself. Pretending to be someone he was not definitely impeded his childhood experience and, as seen later in the book, took him a while to get used to a less extremist way of life that the less poverty-stricken areas of France had to offer.<br><br>
			&emsp;Louis wanted nothing more than to blend in, but people had begun to question why he had never had a girlfriend. This led him to dating two girls, Laura and Sabrina, in order to play the part of someone considered normal. “Becoming a boy necessarily involved girls…I had chosen [Laura] to complete my metamorphosis.” (144, 145) Louis felt comfortable talking to Laura because she was new, an outcast whispered about in the halls like him. They kissed in front of the other students in an attempt to prove his heterosexuality – not only to everyone around him but to himself as well. The insults stopped and turned into questions about their relationship, finally giving Louis a break from the constant harassment. <br><br>
			&emsp;Later on, he had been set up with his sister’s friend Sabrina: “Before I was even able to get a word out, Sabrina spoke up and asked me to explain the reasons why I had wanted to get to know her. But I hadn’t wanted to, it was a lie my sister had told her…As we were kissing, the effort required not to run off, not to cry out in disgust, became more and more intense.” Louis had felt deep down inside that what he was doing was wrong, but everything he learned from the world around him told him it was correct. Getting acceptance from the students in Laura’s case, and later his and Sabrina’s family for their relationship, only furthered Louis’s belief that what he was feeling was wrong, and that having a girlfriend was inherently the correct way to live. Every action he had done was either met with violence or with acceptance, thus teaching him anything he did that didn’t result in violence or pain was correct – the lack of taunting and actual encouragement solidified Louis’s views of what was right and wrong, which went on to affect his actions in the future. <br><br>
			&emsp;There were a lot of preconceived notions in Hallencourt about what was meant for girls and what was meant for boys. There was a vocal correlation between genitals and strength of character: “Most of the time they would say pussy when speaking to me, and pussy was just about the worst insult they could imagine…the one best for conveying disgust, better than asshole or loser. In a world where masculine values are held up as supreme, even my mother would say about herself I’ve got balls, nobody messes with me.” The female genital was associated with weakness and helplessness, and male genital was associated with strength and power. This connection was so ingrained that even the women of the town believed it, giving themselves masculine characteristics to prove their capability. Louis’s mother was the member of his family he was closest to and seeing her confirm this idea of femininity being weak spiraled him deeper into hating those parts of himself. <br><br>
			&emsp;Louis’s first sexual experience was of that with three other boys; they all consensually decided to “play around” the way they would normally do with girls. Louis’s cousin took part and actually convinced Louis to get his sister’s rings to make it more realistic. He said “Eddy, go on, it’ll make it even better…you could steal some rings from your sister, and that way the person who puts on the ring can be the one who plays the woman, who gets fucked…With the rings we’ll know who’s who.” (129) From what they heard and saw, these teenagers learned that the woman was always the one on the bottom, always the one “who gets fucked,” always the one inferior who needs to take what she gets. In turn, the man was the one on top, who gets to do whatever he wants and has all the power; this rendered Louis less of a man for not having the power over his safety regarding the bullies as well as his life in general. In a society where being manly, getting into fights, and defending yourself were essential qualities in being “normal,” Louis was always left feeling inferior and powerless. These gender norms devastated Louis’s development and added to his insecurities. <br><br>
			&emsp;The way Louis was raised and the environment he was raised in are the foundational building blocks that shaped him for the rest of his life. Louis’s experiences put together from physical trauma, emotional abuse, and the smothering gender norms within the microcosmic town of Hallencourt all defined his way of thinking – whether he agreed with or pushed against an idea – and his current life. The End of Eddy showed not only a toxic, harmful atmosphere and the results of growing up in one, but also emphasized Louis’s escape – both physical and mental. The simple act of leaving the town for a boarding school allowed him to break free from an internalized malignancy and self-hatred and later write this book, giving voices to those not as lucky and unable to escape.
